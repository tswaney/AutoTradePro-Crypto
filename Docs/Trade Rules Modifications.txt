Please read this entire post and handle as an overall thought not step by step.

Only allow 22 trades for buys per 24-hour period.

The user needs to be able to enter a cost basis for the cryptos they own when the add them so that we from the start have a cost basis to determine when to sell for profit.

Allow the user to set a minimum profit sell price per trade. 
Make sure that before a sell is made there should be at least 3 returning results within the 30 seconds that were negative to be sure that the trend is heading down, allowing for maximum profit for each sell.
There should be 23 trades left for sells. 

This also leaves 5 trades for emergency STOP LOSS sells.
I will specify the priority of the STOP LOSS trades that should constantly be evaluated while the program is running.

Example: 
To make $400.20 per day
Each sell must profit $17.40 per sell at the minimum.

I will need to test in a separate program make a live buy and sell. Make sure that it is just 1 and just for .01.
I will need to turn on the ability to make live trades for the API. Once I am done testing turn this off. VERY IMPORTANT!!

The ultimate goal is to be able to maintain the same crypto balance while earning a profit on the trends up or down with the crypto. The total earned per day should be derived from trading and learning. At some point I would want the Final Summary to show the average amount per day earned and in the React Native program that will be built this should be a live value that is displayed on the main app screen.
